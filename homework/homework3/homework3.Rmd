**1. Warmup: Posterior Predictive Distributions**

a. What is a posterior predictive distribution (i.e., what does it give probabilities for)? How is this different from the posterior distribution of a parameter?

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

b. Is a posterior predictive model conditional on just the data, just the parameter, or on both the data and the parameter? 

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

c. Why do we need posterior predictive distributions? For example, if we wanted to predict new values of $Y$, why couldn't we just use the posterior mean of the parameter?

**2. Cancer Research in Laboratory Mice**

As a reminder from homework 2, a laboratory is estimating the rate of tumorigenesis (the formation of tumors) in two strains of mice, A and B.  They have tumor count data for 10 mice in strain A and 13 mice in strain B.  Type A mice have been well studied, and information from other laboratories suggests that type A mice have tumor counts that are approximately Poisson-distributed. Tumor count rates for type B mice are unknown, but type B mice are related to type A mice. Assuming a Poisson sampling distribution for each group with rates $\theta_A$ and $\theta_B$. We assume $\theta_A \sim \text{gamma}(120, 10)$ and  $\theta_B\sim\text{gamma}(12, 1)$.  We observe $y_A = (12,9,12,14,13,13,15,8,15,6)$ and
$y_B = (11,11,10,9,9,8,7,10,6,8,8,9,7)$. Now we will actually investigate evidence that Type A mice have higher rates of tumor formation than Type B mice.  

a. Obtain $Pr(\theta_B < \theta_A \mid y_A, y_B)$ via Monte Carlo sampling. Report the value.

```{r tags=c()}
y_A <- c(12, 9, 12, 14, 13, 13, 15, 8, 15, 6)
y_B <- c(11, 11, 10, 9, 9, 8, 7, 10, 6, 8, 8, 9, 7)

# store your probabilities in a vector called "pr" for testing.

# YOUR CODE HERE
pr <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
print(pr)

```
b. Now compute $P\tilde Y_B < \tilde Y_A \mid Y_B, Y_A)$, where $\tilde Y_A$ and $\tilde Y_B$ are samples from the posterior predictive distribution. 

```{r tags=c()}
y_A <- c(12, 9, 12, 14, 13, 13, 15, 8, 15, 6)

# store your probabilities in a vector called "ppr" for testing.

# YOUR CODE HERE
ppr <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
print(ppr)
```
c.  In the context of this problem, describe the meaning of the events $\{\theta_B < \theta_A\}$ and $\{\tilde Y_B < \tilde Y_A\}$.  How are they different? Why do the relative values of the answers in parts a and b make sense?

**3. Posterior Predictive Model Checking**

Model checking and refinement is an essential part of Bayesian data analysis. Let's investigate the adequacy of the Poisson model for the tumor count data. Consider strain A mice only for now, and generate posterior predictive datasets $y_B^{(1)}, ..., y_A^{(1000)}$. Each $y_B^{(s)}$ is a sample of size $n_B = 13$ from the Poisson distribution with parameter $\theta_B^{(s)}$, $\theta_B^{(s)}$ is itself a sample from the posterior distribution $p(\theta_B \mid y_B)$ and $y_B$ is the observed data.  For each $s$, let $t^{(s)}$ be the sample average divided by the sample variance of $y_B^{(s)}$.

a.  If the Poisson model was a reasonable one, what would a "typical" value $t^{(s)}$ be? Why?

b.  In any given experiment, the realized value of $t^{s}$ will not be exactly the "typical value" due to sampling variability.  Make a histogram of $t^{(s)}$ and compare to the observed value of this statistic, $\frac{\text{mean}(y_A)}{\text{var}(y_B)}$. Can sampling variability alone explain the observed test statistic? It may help to compute the fraction of posterior predictive draws which are larger than the observed draws. Make a comment on if the Poisson model seems reasonable for these data (at least by this one metric).  

```{r tags=c()}
y_B = c(11, 11, 10, 9, 9, 8, 7, 10, 6, 8, 8, 9, 7)

# generate posterior predictive datasets and find test statistic for each one
# store your test statistics in a vector called "tb" for testing

# YOUR CODE HERE
```
```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q3b.R")
```

```{r tags=c()}
# create the histogram, adding a vertical line at the observed value of the test statistic
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

c. When the mean is less than the variance we say that the data is _underdispersed_.  When the mean is more than the variance we say that the data is _overdispersed_.  Do you have any evidence that the data is underdispered? Overdispered?
